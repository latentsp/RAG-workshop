## ⚡ Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/latentsp/RAG-workshop.git
   cd RAG-workshop
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up your environment**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

5. **Start the workshop**
   - Navigate to the `exercises/` directory
   - Open the notebook files in VS Code
   - Follow along with the exercises!
