Exercise 1: Demonstrating the Importance of Context in RAG

Objectives: 
- Showcase that right context matters for accurate answers
- Get familiar with the initial RAG setup
- Compare LLM responses without context vs with proper RAG context

This exercise asks specific questions about details from Alice in Wonderland,
first without any context (pure LLM), then with proper book context via RAG.
