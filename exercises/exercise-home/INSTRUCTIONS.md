## 🚀 Build a RAG-Powered Classification Solution!

Choose a **classification problem** from your everyday work that would benefit from Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and build a solution! 🛠️

### 🤔 Why Use RAG for Classification?
RAG can supercharge classification tasks by providing relevant context and improving accuracy. 

Here are some example of everyday work problems that could benefit from RAG:

| 🏷️ Problem | 📝 Example Classes |
|------------|-------------------|
| 🔒 Severity of reported security vulnerabilities | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| 🕵️ Type of security incident | `phishing`, `malware`, `unauthorized access`, `data leak` |
| 🚨 Priority of incident response tickets | `urgent`, `high`, `medium`, `low` |
| ⚠️ Incoming alerts | `true positive`, `false positive`, `benign` |
| 📧 Emails | `phishing`, `spam`, `safe` |
| 📜 Log entries by threat category | `brute force`, `privilege escalation`, `lateral movement` |
| 💬 Customer support requests by product | `firewall`, `endpoint protection`, `SIEM` |
| 📝 Vulnerability reports by system | (e.g., `web server`, `database`, `application`) |
| 🛠️ Code changes by risk level | `high-risk`, `low-risk` |
| 👤 User behavior | `normal`, `suspicious` |
