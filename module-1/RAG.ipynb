    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully implemented a complete RAG system. Here's what we accomplished:\n",

    "### ✅ What We Built:\n",
    "1. **Document Loading**: Read a text file about AI/ML\n",
    "2. **Text Chunking**: Split the document into manageable pieces with overlap\n",
    "3. **Embeddings**: Converted text chunks into vector representations\n",
    "4. **Vector Store**: Stored embeddings in FAISS for efficient similarity search\n",
    "5. **Retrieval**: Found relevant chunks based on user queries\n",
    "6. **Generation**: Combined retrieved context with LLM to generate informed responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Benefits of RAG:\n",
    "- **Current Information**: Can work with up-to-date documents\n",
    "- **Domain Expertise**: Provides specialized knowledge beyond training data\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucination**: Grounds responses in actual source material\n",
    "- **Traceable Sources**: Can identify which chunks informed the response\n",
